Hi, I'm Gianluca Colella, holding a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My journey into game development began during my university studies, where I gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in creating games. I further honed my skills in game development through self-study, focusing particularly on Unity. Over time, I have become proficient in various programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, and web development technologies. I am enthusiastic, ready to learn, and enjoy on embracing new challenges to continually improve and expand my capabilities.

Hi, I'm Tomas
I am a 33 year old game programmer that's currently studying at Futuregames in Stockholm, Sweden. Before that, I worked as a web developer for 9 years.

I describe myself as a problem solver that seeks opportunities to learn new things, at the same time, constantly improving my skills. I enjoy creating games that feel great to play, with clean code that is easy to read. I thrive on difficult challenges, maybe a little too much sometimes as I have a hard time letting go if I can not come up with a solution during a coding session.

Want to know more? You can find my contact information in my resume at the top. You can also reach me on any of my social media.
