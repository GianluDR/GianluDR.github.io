I am Gianluca Colella, holding a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My journey into game development began during my university studies, where I gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in creating games. I further honed my skills in game development through self-study, focusing particularly on Unity. Over time, I have become proficient in various programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, and web development technologies. I am enthusiastic, ready to learn, and enjoy on embracing new challenges to continually improve and expand my capabilities.
