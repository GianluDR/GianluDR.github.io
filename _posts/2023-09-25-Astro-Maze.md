Astro Maze is a puzzle-arcade game with platforming and roguelike elements that challenges the player to solve as many rooms as possible in the shortest amount of time. The game features neon-space themes, where the player is trapped in this vast labyrinth of procedurally generated rooms. Will they manage to escape before the black hole engulfs the maze? The game is straightforward, whether in normal or hardcore mode: you are immediately thrust into a puzzle inside a small room. As you solve various rooms, they progressively become larger, making puzzle-solving more complex. However, you must also keep an eye on the remaining time, indicated by a bar at the top of the screen. If time runs out, it's game over, and you'll have to start over. While solving the puzzles, you can find small trophies that provide a slight amount of extra time. Additionally, you can collect several of these to increase your score. However, the real reward comes from solving the puzzles themselves, which grants you a significantly larger amount of time. The objective of the game is to try to solve as many rooms as possible without dying, making the most out of the time at your disposal.
