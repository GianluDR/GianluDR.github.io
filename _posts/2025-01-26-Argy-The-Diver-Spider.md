## About
"Argy: The Diver Spider" is a 2D platform game inspired by the homonymous spider that has the ability to create air bubbles whenever needed.

## Project info
**üë§ Role:**  Lead programmer  
**üë• Team size:**  6  
**‚è±Ô∏éTime frame:**  3 days
**‚öíÔ∏é Engine:**  Unity(C#)  

In this game, Argy, a diver spider, left his home in search of food supplies but was injured. Therefore, wanted to come back home to her partner, encountering some difficulties along the path.

## What i learned
This was my first game jam, a unique experience where you have to think differently‚Äîthere‚Äôs no time to create everything, so you must keep it simple while still aiming for something fun, original, and engaging. We embraced this mindset by building on the idea of an underwater spider, creating a gameplay loop where you swim, avoid obstacles, manage oxygen by staying inside your bubble, and make your way back home.
