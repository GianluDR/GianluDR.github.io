# What i learned
The experience was exciting and highly educational, as it provided me with valuable insights into game programming, the challenges associated with game development, and the considerable effort required. It emphasized the importance of teamwork, showing how a cohesive group can elevate a game to the next level and smooth out the workload. Throughout this journey, I have developed a strong passion for game programming, willingly devoting my days to coding and exploring new better possibilities.
