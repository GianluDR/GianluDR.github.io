X-Rays is an Action-Adventure Dystopian RPG, aiming to combine the thrill of survival with the curiosity, innate in everyone, to explore and interact with various characters throughout the journey. Set in a fictional time epoch in which the earth is still recovering from its first global nuclear conflict, players take control of ten survivors, originally prisoners, sent to earth as "human probes," who must uncover the conspiracies behind all that has happened and the devastated world in which they must now live. For years and years, the human race has had to fight and survive in a space station, but without knowing what would await them on their homeland: genetically modified plants, animals and humans now turned monsters are ready to endanger "The 10" and change their lives completely.

This project involved a team of five people, including two game designers, two user interface and graphics designers, and myself in the roles of game programming and artificial intelligence. The experience was exciting and highly educational, as it provided me with valuable insights into game programming, the challenges associated with game development, and the considerable effort required. It emphasized the importance of teamwork, showing how a cohesive group can elevate a game to the next level and smooth out the workload. Throughout this journey, I have developed a strong passion for game programming, willingly devoting my days to coding and exploring new better possibilities.

Further insights can be found in the github repository.
